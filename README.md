# Texas-hold-em-poker-game
A simplified Texas hold 'em game implemented with HTML and PHP

## Description
This is not exactly a hold 'em game because players cannot choose to hold or fold their cards. Instead, each player is dealt with 5 cards at once and the system will compare all players' cards and declare the winner.

## How to play?
Simply download **completeDeckOfCards.txt**, **deckOfCards.txt**, **poker.html**, **poker.php** to the same directory and start by opening poker.html.


## Rules used?
I used high hand rules. See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hand_categories) for details.

## Programming languages
I mainly used two languages, HTML and PHP. I used HTML for all the interactive features and used PHP for back-end computing and processing such as dealing cards to players or comparing players' hands. I used ajax to communicate between HTML and PHP. Though insignificant, I used a bit of CSS to achieve some effects for buttons.
